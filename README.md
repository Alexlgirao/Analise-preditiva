Descrição  - Models	 for	Demand	 Forecasting:	The	main	 objective	is	 to	 create	a	model	to predict	 the	 quantity	 sold	 for	
each	product	given	a	prescribed	price.	Along	with	the	statistical	model,	we	need	metrics,	relationships	and	
descriptions	of	these	data	in	order	to	understand	the	sales	behavior.	What	does	the	data	tell	us?	How	are	
the	different	data	sources	related?	Is	there	a	particular	competitor	that	seems	more	important?
